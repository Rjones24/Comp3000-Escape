# Escape!

Escape! is a multiplayer game created using Photonâ€™s PUN-2 API. 
The game has a strong focus on the communication between the two players, 
as they must help each other solve puzzles and avoid hazards, 
all whilst escaping from their office block located in the centre of a town. 

the controls for escape are simple,
WASD to move around the scene looking for clues and items that will help you to escape.
the player can look around the scene with the mouse as well as use the mouse button to pick up and interact with items.

This game was inspired by what I believe to be a lack of communication in some multiplayer games, so I wend about trying to solve this. 
and what better what to try and get people to communicate then to make that one of the main focuses of the game.

when your first load up Escape! you are met with the menu lobby system from here you can enter your gamertag the create your own room or join an existing one. and from there your escape begins.

once you have found a room and a player to play with the game starts. you will spawn in an office themed room.

when you go to leave the room, you will notice the door is locked and there is a scanner telling you to scan your card.

from here onwards your escape begins and the communication between the players becomes key as it is not as simple as just find your key card and escape...
